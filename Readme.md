### 🎓 RAG-Based AI Teaching Assistant

> A fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for course-based semantic Q&A with timestamp-grounded answers.

`Python` &nbsp; `Whisper` &nbsp; `BGE-M3` &nbsp; `Llama 3.2` &nbsp; `Ollama` &nbsp; `Scikit-learn` &nbsp; `Pandas`

**What it does:**
- Students ask natural language questions about lecture videos
- System retrieves the most relevant transcript chunks
- Llama 3.2 generates a grounded answer citing the exact video number and timestamp

**Pipeline:**
```
Video (.mp4) → Audio (.mp3) → Whisper Transcription
→ Window-based Semantic Chunking → BGE-M3 Embeddings
→ Cosine Similarity Search → Llama 3.2 Response
```

**Key Contributions:**
- 🔹 Designed end-to-end local pipeline — zero cloud API dependency
- 🔹 Implemented **window-based chunk merging** (3 segments → 1 chunk) to improve embedding coherence
- 🔹 Used **BGE-M3** for dense vector embeddings stored via `joblib`
- 🔹 Engineered structured `Video / Time / Content` prompt format to reduce LLM hallucination
- 🔹 Served **Llama 3.2** locally via **Ollama** on CPU

**Example:**
```
Ask a Question: Where is the exercise given?

→ In Video 13, between 481.04 and 482.04 seconds,
  the exercise is introduced. Please refer to that section.
